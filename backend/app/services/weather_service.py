# ============================================================================
# WHY THIS STRUCTURE?
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. SEPARATION OF CONCERNS:
#    - fetch_current_weather() = Pure API call (no business logic)
#    - generate_suggestions() = Pure business logic (no API calls)
#    - get_weather_with_suggestions() = Orchestration (combines both)
#    
#    Why? Each function is independently testable and reusable
#
# 2. PRIORITY-BASED RULES:
#    - Rules are checked in order of your importance ranking
#    - Most critical warnings (temp, wind) checked first
#    - Less critical (humidity, UV) checked last
#    - Severity levels help frontend prioritize display
#
# 3. SCHEMA VALIDATION:
#    - CurrentWeather schema ensures API data is valid
#    - WeatherResponse schema ensures complete, consistent output
#    - Pydantic catches issues before they reach the user
#
# 4. ERROR HANDLING:
#    - Custom WeatherAPIError makes debugging clear
#    - Routes can catch this and return helpful error messages
#    - Better than generic exceptions
#
# 5. ASYNC ALL THE WAY:
#    - All I/O operations are async (API calls)
#    - Python can handle multiple requests concurrently
#    - Critical for performance under load
